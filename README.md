# Digit Clasifier Code 

## Description

This project implements a digit classifier neural network built entirely using Python's mathematical libraries (without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks).

The project alows you to:
- Train custom neural network models on digit datasets.
- Use built in analysis tools to evaluate the performance of the neural network.
- Gain insights into the inner workings of neural networkss through a mathematics-based implementation.

## Features

- Custom Neural Network: Customizable parameters iin network model generation.
- Performance Analysis: Visual analysis on the performance of various aspects of the generated network.

## Requirements

1. Python
2. Required libraries:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - os
    - networkx
    - sklearn

## Setup instructions

- Ensure that the Python file and the required CSV file are placed in the same directory.
- Install the necessary Python libraries (if not already instaled).
    
## Usage

- Navagate to the directory containing the Python and CSV files.
- Run the Python file
- Follow the prompts of the script to use the features you want to run.
